                i always tend to do these last even though they are very time consuming, so it makes no sense to do that. this time, i’m getting a head-start. 
                it’s july 13th today, 5:06pm, and <del>i’m about to text you back. </del>i just texted you back. we made it to three years ❤️ ! we’re almost at five, 
                we’re almost at ten, we’re almost at marriage, etc, etc, etc. you’ve made me feel so loved these past three years and have made me into the person i 
                am today and thank you so much for that. i’ve loved every hug, every kiss, every talk, every point of eye contact we’ve made because i get to interact with such a beautiful 
                person–inside and out. you are so beautiful outside and your personality is even more beautiful, especially in those moments when you try to say something but instead 20 different sentences 
                in two languages come out at the same time. that’s cute. tbh i haven’t been feeling my best recently and i hope we can come into a situation soon where we can see each other every day. i want you 
                to be my life and i want you to be my future. <br>i’ve always appreciated every thing you do for me, no matter how big it is, i love you for it.
                i need more time with you though, i can never get enough of you.
                i wanna go on errands w you if your nearby or if i’m near you.
                i wanna continue exploring and seeing the world with you. here’s to <a href="/3years/countdown.html">four, five years ❤️</a><br><sub>when you read this tell me you love me ❤️</sub></div><span class="console-input">_</span></div></div></div></body></html>
