        | letters are always the hardest parts of updating the websites just because its not coded 😭. i always tend to do these last even though they are very time consuming, so it makes no sense to do that. this time, i’m getting a head-start. it’s july 13th today, 5:06pm, and 
          del i’m about to text you back. 
        | i just texted you back. we made it to three years ❤️ ! we’re almost at five, we’re almost at ten, we’re almost at marriage, etc, etc, etc. you’ve made me feel so loved these past three years and have made me into the person i am today and thank you so much for that. i’ve loved every hug, every kiss, every talk, every point of eye contact we’ve made because i get to interact with such a beautiful person–inside and out. you are so beautiful outside and your personality is even more beautiful, especially in those moments when you try to say something but instead 20 different sentences in two languages come out at the same time. that’s cute. tbh i haven’t been feeling my best recently and i hope we can come into a situation soon where we can see each other every day. i want you to be my life and i want you to be my future.
