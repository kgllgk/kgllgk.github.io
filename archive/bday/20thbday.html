                Twenty, a scary year for sure. It will bring a lot of questions, like "Why
                can I vote but not drink? This is basically 19 all over again. And it pretty
                much is. Twenty is a second chance in a way. All of the things that made
                you down at 19 is what gives you the opportunity to address these in
                this new year of age. Good luck, I believe in you! A year to make your work life
                better your knowledge more expanded, and hopefully a way where we could live into
                enjoy better times. I will continue to try to be better for you. I want to make you
                the happiest. You are so many steps ahead of me, proud of you, but give me at least two years
                to catch up! We gon’ be living good!!! Lowkey I'm rereading this paragraph and it's
                giving Walt Whitman. <br>
                It's the next day now. I'm so tired and I have to get ready for bed, but
                all I can think about is you. I get so frustrated that I can't see you all
                the time, so I'll try to work on that in this next year. I'm going to
                yet you flowers in the morning and I'll pick the prettiest ones because
                you deserve it. You deserve them every day. When I get a good job, I'll
                make sure that that becomes true. Listening to beautiful music rn,
                all I picture is dancing with you to it. The thing that sucks
                is some songs are so beautiful-but the lyrics are not at
                all relating to us or our situation lol, I should make one,
                perfect for you. Or maybe perfect for me and it has some
                beautiful dubstep vibes. Ok now it's actually time for me
                to sleep, so goodnight! Below is a list I made yesterday:<br>
                <ul>Things we should do soon
                    <li>movie date</li>
                    <li>bake together</li>
                    <li>more in 17</li>
                    <li>go to the beach (lets plan ahead)</li>
                    <li>play VR again, more games! (You should get an xbox)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Anyways,,,,,,, onto your gifts. I got you a water bottle, it's super cute, and has
                time! Promise that you'll try! I got you two portable chargers. There are notes inside of them
                which says the difference. I couldn't decide which one to get you, so I got both
                keep the one you want more, and I'll return the other. If you really want both, then you can
                have both. Its up to you! I hope cici didn’t also get you one. As Jesus Christ once
                said, "The more the merrier." I hope you enjoy your flowers, I love you. <a href="https://2kimmy.com/images/happy20th/kim19thletter.jpg">Happy 20th baby</a>, many
                more of these to come.<br>
